## [1.2.3] - 2025-07-16

### üîß Critical Bug Fixes and Function Implementations

#### [1.2.3] - Missing Function Errors Resolution
**Issue:** Multiple undefined function errors causing board creation failures
**Root Cause:** Functions were being called but never implemented in the codebase

**Missing Functions Fixed:**
1. **validateWorkspaceRealTime is not defined** (line 862)
2. **validateWorkspace is not defined** (line 1543)
3. **getAvailableWorkspaces is not defined** (lines 238, 1482, 1518)

**Solutions Implemented:**
- **Created `validateWorkspaceRealTime()` function** (`script.js:881-931`):
  - Non-blocking workspace validation for real-time feedback
  - Uses Monday.com API to verify workspace existence
  - Provides visual feedback with loading/success/warning indicators
  - Graceful error handling without blocking form submission
  - Only runs if API token is available

- Items creation consistently failed during board creation
- Error: "Invalid column value format. Please check your data."
- Status column was using `{ label: "Not Started" }` format
- Monday.com API expected `{ "index": 0 }` format for status columns

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Fixed status column format** (`script.js:1987, 1990, 1995`):
  - **Before:** `{ label: "Not Started" }` (caused API errors)
  - **After:** `{ "index": 0 }` (proper Monday.com format)
  - Applied to both planning and renovation tasks

- **Enhanced error handling** (`script.js:1934-1971`):
  - Comprehensive debugging information for failed item creation
  - Shows available created columns for troubleshooting
  - Displays both formatted and raw column values
  - Automatic retry with minimal column values on format errors
  - Fallback to basic text column only if complex columns fail

- **Documentation:** Dedicated photo column for project documentation
- **Status Tracking:** Standardized status column for progress monitoring

**Board Creation Process (Updated):**
1. Pre-flight validation (5%)
2. Create board in Monday.com (15%)
3. **Create standard columns (25%)** - NEW STEP
4. Create groups and sections (45%)
5. Create tasks and items (80%)
6. Finalize board setup (95%)
7. Complete (100%)

**Column Details:**
- **PM Column:** `person` type, empty by default for manual assignment
- **Photos Column:** `file` type, empty by default for manual upload
- **Status Column:** `status` type, defaults to "Not Started"
- **Timeline Column:** `timeline` type, with smart date ranges:
  - Planning tasks: 2-week duration from today
  - Renovation tasks: 1-month duration starting after planning

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Maintains existing column value structure for legacy support
- Fallback to default columns if new column creation fails
- Existing boards created before this update will continue working normally

**Performance Impact:**
- Adds ~1-2 seconds to board creation time for column creation
- Rate limited to prevent API overload
- Enhanced error handling for column creation failures

## [1.2.1] - 2025-01-15

### üîß Critical Bug Fixes and API Improvements

#### [1.2.1] - Button Functionality and Validation Fixes
**Issue:** "Next: Review & Confirm" button not working - users unable to proceed to confirmation step
**Root Cause Analysis:** Investigation revealed the button WAS working, but failing due to overly strict workspace ID validation

**Problem Details:**
- Button appeared non-functional to users
- Error: "Workspace ID must be 8-12 digits"
- Monday.com workspace IDs can have various formats (letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores)
- Validation rejected valid workspace IDs that didn't match the strict numeric-only pattern

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Updated workspace ID validation in `renovation-data.js`:**
  - **Before:** Required exactly 8-12 digits only (`/^\d{8,12}$/`)
  - **After:** Accepts 3-50 characters with letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores (`/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/`)
- **Enhanced error messages** to be more descriptive and user-friendly
- **Maintains security** while being flexible enough for real-world Monday.com workspace IDs

#### [1.2.1] - Monday.com API Group Creation Error Fix
**Issue:** Board creation failing with API error during group creation
**Error:** "Unknown argument 'color' on field 'Mutation.create_group'"
**Root Cause:** Monday.com API doesn't accept the `color` parameter in `create_group` mutations

**Problem Details:**
- All board creation attempts failed at the group creation stage
- GraphQL API rejected the `color` parameter
- Application was trying to set group colors during creation
- Complete board creation process was blocked

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Removed color parameter from group creation mutation in `script.js`:**
  ```javascript
  // BEFORE (caused error):
  create_group(board_id: $boardId, group_name: $groupName, color: $color)
  
  // AFTER (working):
  create_group(board_id: $boardId, group_name: $groupName)
  ```
- **Updated group data structures in `renovation-data.js`:**
  - Removed `color` properties from all group objects
  - Maintained group positioning and titles
  - Updated legacy structure generation to exclude color references
- **Verified API compatibility** with Monday.com GraphQL v2 specifications

#### [1.2.1] - User Experience Improvements
