### üîß Critical Bug Fixes and Function Implementations

#### [1.2.3] - Missing Function Errors Resolution
**Issue:** Multiple undefined function errors causing board creation failures
**Root Cause:** Functions were being called but never implemented in the codebase

**Missing Functions Fixed:**
1. **validateWorkspaceRealTime is not defined** (line 862)
2. **validateWorkspace is not defined** (line 1543)
3. **getAvailableWorkspaces is not defined** (lines 238, 1482, 1518)

**Solutions Implemented:**
- **Created `validateWorkspaceRealTime()` function** (`script.js:881-931`):
  - Non-blocking workspace validation for real-time feedback
  - Uses Monday.com API to verify workspace existence
  - Provides visual feedback with loading/success/warning indicators
  - Graceful error handling without blocking form submission
  - Only runs if API token is available

- **Created `validateWorkspace()` function** (`script.js:933-968`):
  - Blocking workspace validation for board creation
  - Validates workspace exists and is accessible via Monday.com API
  - Returns workspace details if valid, throws errors if invalid
  - Proper logging for debugging board creation issues

- **Created `getAvailableWorkspaces()` function** (`script.js:970-1000`):
  - Fetches all accessible workspaces for fallback logic
  - Uses GraphQL query: `query { workspaces { id name description } }`
  - Returns array of workspace objects for fallback selection
  - Handles API errors gracefully with descriptive error messages

#### [1.2.3] - Column Value Format Error Fix
**Issue:** Item creation failing with "Invalid column value format" error
**Root Cause:** Status column was using incorrect format for Monday.com API

**Problem Details:**
- Items creation consistently failed during board creation
- Error: "Invalid column value format. Please check your data."
- Status column was using `{ label: "Not Started" }` format
- Monday.com API expected `{ "index": 0 }` format for status columns

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Fixed status column format** (`script.js:1987, 1990, 1995`):
  - **Before:** `{ label: "Not Started" }` (caused API errors)
  - **After:** `{ "index": 0 }` (proper Monday.com format)
  - Applied to both planning and renovation tasks

- **Enhanced error handling** (`script.js:1934-1971`):
  - Comprehensive debugging information for failed item creation
  - Shows available created columns for troubleshooting
  - Displays both formatted and raw column values
  - Automatic retry with minimal column values on format errors
  - Fallback to basic text column only if complex columns fail

#### [1.2.3] - Favicon 404 Error Fix
**Issue:** Browser requesting `/favicon.ico` that didn't exist
**Solution:** Added inline SVG favicon with house emoji (üè†) in `index.html:7`
**Result:** Eliminated 404 errors and provided appropriate icon for renovation app

## [1.2.2] - 2025-01-16

### üöÄ New Feature: Standard Columns for All Boards

#### [1.2.2] - Automatic Standard Column Creation
**Feature:** All boards now automatically include four essential columns for every project
**Implementation:** Enhanced board creation workflow with column creation step

**New Standard Columns:**
- **PM Column** (Person type): For assigning Project Manager to tasks
- **Photos Column** (File type): For uploading project photos and documentation
- **Status Column** (Status type): For tracking task status and progress
- **Timeline Column** (Timeline type): For project scheduling and dates

**Technical Implementation:**
- **New Function:** `createStandardColumns()` - Creates the four required columns after board creation
- **Enhanced Workflow:** Added column creation step (25% progress) in main board creation process
- **Smart Column Usage:** `createColumnValues()` now uses the created column IDs for proper column value assignment
- **Graceful Fallback:** If column creation fails, the system continues with default columns
- **State Management:** Added `createdColumns` to AppState to track column IDs

**User Benefits:**
- **Consistent Structure:** Every board has the same essential columns for standardization
- **Project Management:** Built-in PM assignment and timeline tracking
- **Documentation:** Dedicated photo column for project documentation
- **Status Tracking:** Standardized status column for progress monitoring

**Board Creation Process (Updated):**
1. Pre-flight validation (5%)
2. Create board in Monday.com (15%)
3. **Create standard columns (25%)** - NEW STEP
4. Create groups and sections (45%)
5. Create tasks and items (80%)
6. Finalize board setup (95%)
7. Complete (100%)

**Column Details:**
- **PM Column:** `person` type, empty by default for manual assignment
- **Photos Column:** `file` type, empty by default for manual upload
- **Status Column:** `status` type, defaults to "Not Started"
- **Timeline Column:** `timeline` type, with smart date ranges:
  - Planning tasks: 2-week duration from today
  - Renovation tasks: 1-month duration starting after planning

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Maintains existing column value structure for legacy support
- Fallback to default columns if new column creation fails
- Existing boards created before this update will continue working normally

**Performance Impact:**
- Adds ~1-2 seconds to board creation time for column creation
- Rate limited to prevent API overload
- Enhanced error handling for column creation failures

## [1.2.1] - 2025-01-15

### üîß Critical Bug Fixes and API Improvements

#### [1.2.1] - Button Functionality and Validation Fixes
**Issue:** "Next: Review & Confirm" button not working - users unable to proceed to confirmation step
**Root Cause Analysis:** Investigation revealed the button WAS working, but failing due to overly strict workspace ID validation

**Problem Details:**
- Button appeared non-functional to users
- Error: "Workspace ID must be 8-12 digits"
- Monday.com workspace IDs can have various formats (letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores)
- Validation rejected valid workspace IDs that didn't match the strict numeric-only pattern

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Updated workspace ID validation in `renovation-data.js`:**
  - **Before:** Required exactly 8-12 digits only (`/^\d{8,12}$/`)
  - **After:** Accepts 3-50 characters with letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores (`/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/`)
- **Enhanced error messages** to be more descriptive and user-friendly

#### [1.2.1] - Monday.com API Group Creation Error Fix
**Issue:** Board creation failing with API error during group creation
**Error:** "Unknown argument 'color' on field 'Mutation.create_group'"
**Root Cause:** Monday.com API doesn't accept the `color` parameter in `create_group` mutations

**Problem Details:**
- All board creation attempts failed at the group creation stage
- GraphQL API rejected the `color` parameter
- Application was trying to set group colors during creation
- Complete board creation process was blocked

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Removed color parameter from group creation mutation in `script.js`:**
  ```javascript
  // BEFORE (caused error):
  create_group(board_id: $boardId, group_name: $groupName, color: $color)
  
  // AFTER (working):
  create_group(board_id: $boardId, group_name: $groupName)
  ```
- **Updated group data structures in `renovation-data.js`:**
  - Removed `color` properties from all group objects
  - Maintained group positioning and titles
