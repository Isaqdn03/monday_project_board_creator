## API Integration

The application uses Monday.com's GraphQL API v2 with the following operations:

### Authentication
- Personal API token authentication
- Secure token storage in localStorage
- Connection validation on startup

### Board Creation Flow
1. **Create Board**: Creates new board in specified workspace
2. **Create Groups**: Adds groups for each renovation area
3. **Create Items**: Populates items for planning tasks and scopes
4. **Rate Limiting**: Includes delays to respect API limits

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages
- Retry functionality for failed operations
- Graceful degradation for network issues

## Configuration

### API Token Storage
- Stored securely in browser localStorage
- Automatically loaded on app restart
- Can be updated via settings modal

### Workspace Configuration
- Workspace ID required for board creation
- Can be found in Monday.com URL or developer tools
- Saved per project for convenience

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Connection Failed**
   - Verify API token is correct
   - Check Monday.com account permissions
   - Ensure token has required scopes

2. **Board Creation Failed**
   - Verify workspace ID is correct
   - Check API rate limits
   - Ensure sufficient permissions

3. **Server Won't Start**
   - Check if port is already in use
   - Try different port: `python server.py 3000`
   - Verify Python/Node.js installation

4. **Application Won't Load**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify all files are in correct location
   - Clear browser cache

### Getting Help

1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify API token permissions in Monday.com
3. Test API connection using the built-in test feature
4. Review Monday.com API documentation for latest changes

## Security Considerations

- API tokens are stored in browser localStorage (client-side only)
- No server-side storage of sensitive data
- CORS headers configured for development
- Token validation on every API request
