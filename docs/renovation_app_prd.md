# Renovation Project Manager - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

### Product Overview
Internal web application that automatically creates standardized Monday.com project boards for renovation projects based on user-selected areas and scopes of work.

### Problem Statement
Creating renovation project boards in Monday.com is currently manual, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Each project requires setting up the same basic structure plus specific tasks based on renovation areas, leading to:
- Wasted setup time
- Inconsistent project organization
- Missing standard planning phases
- Human error in task creation

### Solution
A simple web app that guides users through area selection, generates appropriate scopes, and automatically creates structured Monday.com boards with consistent planning phases and area-specific tasks.

## Product Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Efficiency**: Reduce project board creation time from 30+ minutes to under 5 minutes
2. **Consistency**: Ensure all renovation projects include standard "Design and Planning" phase
3. **Completeness**: Automatically include all relevant tasks based on renovation scope
4. **Simplicity**: Require minimal training for team adoption

### Success Metrics
- Time to create project board: < 5 minutes
- User adoption rate: 90% of renovation projects use the tool
- Reduced setup errors: 0 missing standard planning tasks
- User satisfaction: Tool saves significant time and effort

- **API Integration**: Monday.com API v2
- **Deployment**: Local file or simple web server
- **Authentication**: Monday.com API token

### Performance Requirements
- Page load time: < 2 seconds
- Board creation time: < 30 seconds
- Offline capability: Not required
- Browser support: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Security Requirements
- API token security (environment variable or secure storage)
- Input validation for all user inputs
- Error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Usability
- **Learning Curve**: < 5 minutes for new users
- **Interface**: Simple, form-based workflow
- **Accessibility**: Basic keyboard navigation
- **Documentation**: Minimal setup instructions

### Reliability
- **Uptime**: Dependent on Monday.com API availability
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages and retry options
- **Data Validation**: Prevent incomplete board creation

### Scalability
- **Users**: Designed for internal team (< 50 users)
- **Projects**: No limit on number of projects created
- **Data**: Stateless application, no data persistence required

## User Interface Requirements

### Page Flow
1. **Landing Page**: Project name input + area selection
2. **Scope Selection**: Dynamic dropdowns for selected areas
3. **Confirmation**: Review selections before board creation
4. **Success Page**: Board link and project summary

### Design Principles
- **Minimal**: No unnecessary visual elements
- **Functional**: Clear labels and logical flow
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and tablet
- **Fast**: No loading animations or complex interactions

## Integration Requirements

### Monday.com API
- **Authentication**: Bearer token
- **Endpoints**: Board creation, group creation, item creation
- **Rate Limits**: Respect API limitations
- **Error Handling**: Handle API failures gracefully

### Data Sources
- **Static Configuration**: Renovation areas and scopes from provided document
- **User Input**: Project name, selected areas, selected scopes
- **Generated Data**: Board structure based on selections

## Testing Requirements

### Functional Testing
- Verify all renovation areas display correctly
- Confirm scope dropdowns populate based on area selection
- Validate Monday.com board creation with correct structure
- Test error handling for API failures

### User Acceptance Testing
- Project managers can create boards in under 5 minutes
- All created boards include Design and Planning section
- Generated boards match expected task structure
- Users can successfully access created Monday.com boards

## Launch Plan

### Phase 1: Core Development (Week 1-2)
- Build area selection interface
- Implement scope dropdown generation
- Integrate Monday.com API for board creation

### Phase 2: Testing & Refinement (Week 3)
- Internal testing with sample projects
- Bug fixes and user experience improvements
- Documentation creation

### Phase 3: Deployment (Week 4)
- Deploy to internal team
- Training session (< 30 minutes)
- Monitor usage and gather feedback

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Monday.com API changes**: Monitor API documentation, implement error handling
- **Rate limiting**: Implement request throttling and user feedback

### User Adoption Risks
- **Resistance to change**: Emphasize time savings and consistency benefits
- **Training needs**: Create simple documentation and quick demo

### Operational Risks
- **API key security**: Secure storage and rotation procedures
- **Maintenance**: Document code for future updates

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- Project templates beyond renovation
- Integration with other project management tools
- Advanced task dependencies and timelines
- Historical project data and analytics
- Mobile app version
