# Renovation Project Manager - Implementation Plan

## Task 1: Project Setup and Configuration

### 1.1 Development Environment Setup
**Deliverable:** Basic project structure and development environment
- Create project folder structure (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `renovation-data.js`)
- Set up local development server (Python `http.server` or Node.js `live-server`)
- Configure environment variables for Monday.com API token storage
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Project opens in browser, API token can be securely accessed

### 1.2 Renovation Data Structure Creation
**Deliverable:** Complete renovation areas and scopes data configuration
- Extract all renovation areas from provided document into JavaScript object structure
- Create detailed scope arrays for each renovation area (Kitchen, Bathroom, Living Room, etc.)
- Implement "Design and Planning" standard tasks configuration
- **Acceptance Criteria:** All 15 renovation areas with complete scope lists, standardized planning tasks defined

### 1.3 Basic Authentication Implementation
**Deliverable:** Monday.com API authentication system
- Implement API token validation function using Monday.com `/v2` endpoint
- Create error handling for invalid or expired tokens
- Set up API request headers structure (`Authorization`, `Content-Type`, `API-Version`)
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Successful authentication test with Monday.com API, proper error messages for invalid tokens

## Task 2: User Interface Development

### 2.1 Area Selection Interface
**Deliverable:** Checkbox-based area selection form
- Create HTML form with checkboxes for all 15 renovation areas
- Implement JavaScript validation requiring minimum one area selection
- Add "Next" button activation logic based on selections
- **Acceptance Criteria:** All areas display correctly, multi-select works, validation prevents empty submissions

### 2.2 Dynamic Scope Dropdown System
**Deliverable:** Conditional dropdown generation based on area selections
- Build JavaScript function to dynamically create dropdowns for selected areas
- Populate each dropdown with area-specific renovation scopes from data structure
- Implement required selection validation for each generated dropdown
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Dropdowns appear only for selected areas, populated with correct scopes, validation works

### 2.3 Project Details and Confirmation Interface
**Deliverable:** Project input and review pages
- Create project name input field with validation
- Build confirmation page showing selected areas and scopes summary
- Implement success/error result pages with Monday.com board links
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Clean project name validation, clear selection summary, proper success/error feedback

## Task 3: Monday.com API Integration

### 3.1 API Connection and Board Creation
**Deliverable:** Basic Monday.com board creation functionality
- Implement `create_board` mutation using GraphQL API
- Set up workspace selection (default to main workspace)
- Add board naming logic using project name input
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Successfully creates boards in Monday.com account, proper error handling for API failures

### 3.2 Group Creation System
**Deliverable:** Automated group/section creation within boards
- Implement "Design and Planning" group creation (always first)
- Add dynamic group creation for each selected renovation area
- Set up proper group ordering and naming conventions
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Design and Planning group always created first, renovation area groups created correctly

### 3.3 Item/Task Population Logic
**Deliverable:** Automatic task creation within groups
- Implement `create_item` mutations for standard planning tasks
- Add item creation for selected renovation scopes within appropriate groups
- Set up basic column structure (Status, Assignee, Due Date, Priority, Notes)
- **Acceptance Criteria:** All selected scopes become items in correct groups, standard columns configured properly

## Task 4: Data Processing and Board Creation Logic

### 4.1 Selection Processing Engine
**Deliverable:** Data transformation from user input to API format
- Create function to process checkbox selections into area arrays
- Implement dropdown selection processing into scope mapping object
- Build data validation to ensure complete selections before API calls
- **Acceptance Criteria:** User selections correctly transformed to API-ready format, validation prevents incomplete data

### 4.2 Board Structure Generation
**Deliverable:** Complete board structure logic based on selections
- Implement board creation workflow: Board → Groups → Items
- Create proper sequencing to handle Monday.com API rate limits
- Add progress indicators for multi-step board creation process
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Boards created with proper structure, rate limits respected, progress feedback provided

### 4.3 Error Handling and Validation System
**Deliverable:** Comprehensive error management
- Implement Monday.com API error handling (authentication, rate limits, invalid data)
- Add client-side validation for all user inputs
- Create user-friendly error messages and recovery options
- **Acceptance Criteria:** All error scenarios handled gracefully, clear user feedback, recovery options available

## Task 5: Testing and Deployment

### 5.1 Functional Testing Implementation
**Deliverable:** Comprehensive test coverage
- Test all 15 renovation areas display and selection functionality
- Verify dropdown generation for various area combinations
- Validate Monday.com board creation with different scope selections
- **Acceptance Criteria:** All renovation areas work correctly, various selection combinations create proper boards

### 5.2 User Acceptance Testing
**Deliverable:** Real-world usage validation
- Conduct testing with actual project managers using real renovation scenarios
- Measure board creation time (target < 5 minutes)
- Validate created boards match expected structure and include all required elements
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Users can create boards under 5 minutes, boards contain all expected elements, user feedback positive

### 5.3 Documentation and Deployment
**Deliverable:** Production-ready application with documentation
- Create user guide with screenshots and step-by-step instructions
- Document API token setup and security procedures
- Deploy application to internal team with access instructions
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Complete documentation available, secure deployment accessible to team, training materials ready

## Implementation Timeline

**Week 1:** Tasks 1-2 (Setup and UI Development)
**Week 2:** Task 3 (Monday.com API Integration)
**Week 3:** Task 4 (Data Processing and Logic)
**Week 4:** Task 5 (Testing and Deployment)

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Monday.com account with API access
- API token with appropriate permissions (`boards:read`, `boards:write`, `items:write`)
- Basic web server capability for hosting
- Test workspace in Monday.com for development and testing

## Risk Mitigation

- **API Rate Limits:** Implement exponential backoff and request throttling
